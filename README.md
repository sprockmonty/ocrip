# ocrip
Ocrip is a tool (currently a collection of bash scripts) for outputting all the text currently on your screen. Simple right? Well think of it more as a software independent copy and paste. Why should you have to type out that command you saw in a screenshot? You can use ocrip to get the text for you, and pipe it into your favourite fuzzy finder (such as fzf).
